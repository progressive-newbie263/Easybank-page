 FEM's easybank landing page challenge.

- hello, its me, JackFrost again. Today i decided to finally take a difficulty level 3 in Frontend Mentor challenge.

- while javascript was fairly merciful with this one, CSS was living hell haha. While i can do some works on it, it was still a bit harder than my current abilities.
I had lots of struggle designing the format for the home-section, more precisely making the 4 phones images lying above the greenie. Eventually i have to do some
researches and a video from an indian coder on youtube really help me a lot : https://www.youtube.com/@codewithsadee

- I learnt a lot from doing this challenge, special thanks to Sadee again. Hope the next time i do a project, i can finally apply frameworks skills into it.

- Last but not least, the model i used to look up for designing is amazingly designed by the goat tediko  https://easybank-tediko.netlify.app/#, he always nailed the challenges of FEM perfectly and i am grateful of it.
